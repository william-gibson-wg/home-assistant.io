This integration supports some 8-outlet and 16-outlet power strip "PDU"s from Avocent. Select the number of outlets your PDU has.

The username and password should be the same as those used in the manufacturer's website if they have been changed from the default values.

### Supported devices:

* DPDU101 (tested)
* DPDU102
* DPDU103
* DPDU201
* DPDU202
* DPDU203

#### Switches:
The 8 or 16 Switch/Outlet entities will be constructed based on configuration.

Their names will be obtained from the PDU.
